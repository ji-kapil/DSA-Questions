## ‚úÖ Practice Pattern

<Start topic ‚Üí Learn theory ‚Üí Solve 5-10 basic problems ‚Üí Move to medium>

üîÅ <DSA Learning Pattern (Short & Effective):
1. Programming Basics

>Learn a language: C++, Java, or Python 

Focus: Loops, Conditionals, Functions, Arrays, Recursion

2. Basic Data Structures

Arrays & Strings

Linked List (Singly/Doubly)

Stack

Queue (including Circular & Deque)

üß† Practice: Easy problems on each topic (LeetCode, GFG)

3. Recursion & Backtracking

Basic recursion patterns

Backtracking: N-Queens, Sudoku, Subsets, Permutations

4. Searching & Sorting

Binary Search (on arrays & answers)

Sorting Algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Merge, Quick

Practice binary search problems

5. Hashing & Maps

HashMap, HashSet

Applications: Frequency count, Two Sum, Anagrams

6. Sliding Window & Two Pointers

Fixed & Variable window

Problems: Max sum subarray, Longest substring without repeat

7. Greedy Algorithms

Activity Selection, Fractional Knapsack, Job Scheduling

Always try to prove greedy choice is optimal

8. Dynamic Programming (DP)

Start with 1D DP: Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs

Then move to 2D: Knapsack, LCS, DP on grids

Practice: Tabulation + Memoization

9. Trees & Binary Trees

DFS, BFS (Level Order), Inorder/Pre/Post

Binary Search Tree (BST) ‚Äì Insert/Delete/Search

10. Graphs

Representations: Adjacency List/Matrix

DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Topo Sort, Union-Find

Problems: Cycle detection, Shortest path, MST

11. Tries, Heaps, and Advanced Topics (Optional)

Trie: Prefix search

Heap: Priority Queue, Heap Sort

Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree (for range queries)
